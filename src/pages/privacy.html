            Collect Personal Information In this section of the Privacy Policy, we explain where and how we collect
            personal
            information. Customers: Much of the personal information that plusoption collects comes directly or
            indirectly
            from
            our customers and prospective customers. Information that is collected directly from you is information that
            you
            provide when you complete a form online, upload a document, use a chat feature, or speak to us on the phone.
            We
            may
            also collect information indirectly about you when you interact with our website, using cookies and other
            tracking
            technologies. Related Parties: We may collect information about you from someone you know. For instance, if
            you
            are
            a shareholder in a business that is formed through plusoption, we may be given information about you by that
            business to complete the formation. We may also receive information about you from customers using our
            products

            send communications to you, such as our e-signature product. Service Providers: We may collect information
            about
            you
            from our Service Providers or other companies that we work with to deliver products to you. As used in this
            Privacy
            Policy, Service Providers means entities that plusoption has contracted with to provide us with services to
            help
            fulfill our business needs. An example of the type of information that we may receive from a Service
            Provider is
            information about whether any Legal Mail has been received as part of our Registered Agent services. Service
            Providers may also assist us in collecting information both directly and indirectly from you. Professionals
            (including attorneys and Tax Experts): We may receive information about you from the attorneys you work with
            through
            our Legal Plan or other product offerings. plusoption does not intend to collect any information from

            where the collection would result in a waiver of the attorney-client privilege. With your consent, and as
            described
            in the LZ Tax Privacy Policy, we may also receive information about you from LZ Tax. Business Partners: We
            may
            receive information about you from our Business Partners. As used in this Privacy Policy, Business Partners
            means
            entities that plusoption has contracted with to engage in cross-promotional or product integration
            activities.
            An
            example of the type of information that we may receive from our business partners is information about the
            products
            you purchased from them. Affiliates and Subsidiaries: We may receive information about you from our
            affiliates
            and
            subsidiaries. For example, if we acquire an ownership interest in a company, we may receive information
            about
            you as
            part of that acquisition if you have previously done business with them. Publicly/Commercially Available
            Information: We may collect information about you from publicly available sources of information, including
            government records, social media sites, and other commercially available sources of personal information.

            of the type of information we may collect from publicly available sources are whether your entity is in good
            standing with a Secretary of State or whether you have recently expressed interest in purchasing a product
            that
            plusoption sells. Unrelated Parties: We may receive information related to you from people and entities with
            whom
            plusoption does not have a direct relationship. An example of the type of information that we may receive
            from
            unrelated third parties are documents that we receive on your behalf in our role as your Registered Agent.

            may
            share
            personal information with our service providers who assist us with running our business. These companies are
            not
            authorized to use the information we share with them for any purpose other than providing services to
            plusoption
            or
            to you. Businesses Providing Services: plusoption may disclose personal information with other businesses to
            provide
            you with products and services. Personal information disclosed to other businesses will be subject to those
            third
            parties’ privacy practices. For instance, we may use FedEx, the United States Postal Service, or other
            shipping
            providers to deliver physical products you have purchased. Similarly, we may use WorldPay, Adyen, or Stripe
            for
            purposes of processing payments or providing identity verification services. In doing so, these processors
            may
            collect and process personal information for its uses, including improving its services and for fraud
            detection
            and
            prevention. Professionals (including attorneys and Tax Experts): We may share personal information with
            attorneys
            and Tax Experts whose services can be accessed through products such as our legal plans and
            attorney-assisted
            products. Business Partners: plusoption may share personal information with business partners. When we share
            personal information with business partners, it will generally be subject to their privacy policy. We share
            information with business partners in the following circumstances: If you express interest in an offer
            presented
            to
            you either by plusoption on behalf of a business partner or by a business partner on behalf of plusoption,
            you
            are
            directing plusoption to provide information about you to that business partner. If you purchase a plusoption
            product
            that is bundled with a product offered by one of our business partners, we will share information about you
            with
            that business partner. Parties Related to You: We may provide information about you to someone you know or
            that
            you
            have connected with through our platform. For instance, we may provide information connected to your
            plusoption
            account with your authorized contacts. We may provide information about you to a customer requesting that
            you
            sign a
            document, such as whether you have completed the signature process. Government Entities: plusoption may
            share
            information about customers with government entities to fulfill the products purchased by our customers.
            Certain
            personal information becomes public record when documents are filed with the federal or a state government,
            or
            with
            a court. For example, a corporation's name, business address, and registered agent name becomes public
            information
            when its articles of incorporation are filed. A Secretary of State may publish this information to its
            website
            or
            provide this information to third parties. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office publishes the names and
            addresses of
            trademark registrants. This Privacy Policy does not cover these or similar third-party actions. Public
            Disclosures:
            plusoption may publicly disclose personal information in limited circumstances. We may share information
            publicly
            when it is necessary to fulfill a product that has been purchased by a customer. For example, in some
            states,
            fictitious business names, including the name and address of the business owner, must be published in a
            newspaper.

            that
            are
            posted to publicly available websites. When you post content in any forum or comment area on our website,
            these
            posts may be publicly available. You should use caution when deciding whether to disclose your personal
            information
            in public areas of our website. When we collect publicly available information, we may share that
            information on
            our
            website. Registered Agent Requests: If you designate a person or company other than plusoption to serve as
            the
            registered agent for your business entity, plusoption may provide your name and contact information to that
            party,
            if the designee requests. Required by Law: plusoption may disclose personal information as required by law,
            such
            as
            in response to a subpoena or a lawful request by a public authority, including to meet national security or
            law
            enforcement requirements, or similar legal processes. We may also disclose personal information when we
            believe
            in
            good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others,
            investigate fraud, or respond to a legitimate request from a government entity. Parties Related to
            plusoption:
            plusoption may disclose personal information with businesses controlling, controlled by, or under common
            control

            transferred, we may disclose or transfer consumer data in connection with the associated transactions. How
